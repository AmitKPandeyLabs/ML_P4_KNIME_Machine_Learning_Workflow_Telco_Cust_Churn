# KNIME Based Machine Learning: Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive, end-to-end machine learning workflow developed entirely within the **KNIME Analytics Platform**. The primary objective is to build a robust predictive model for identifying customers at high risk of churning in the telecommunications sector. By leveraging KNIME's visual programming capabilities, this project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline from initial data access and preprocessing to advanced model training, evaluation, and interactive result visualization.

This solution empowers telecom companies to implement proactive retention strategies, thereby mitigating revenue loss due to customer attrition.

## Project Context & Objectives

The telecommunications industry faces significant challenges with customer churn. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project addresses the need for an efficient and accurate system to:

* **Identify potential churners:** Pinpoint customers exhibiting characteristics commonly associated with churn.
* **Understand churn drivers:** Gain insights into which factors most influence a customer's decision to leave.
* **Enable proactive intervention:** Provide actionable predictions to support targeted customer retention campaigns.

This project focuses on building a robust, interpretable, and maintainable predictive model using
